# Cloud-DevOps
Cloud and DevOps exercise 

Cloud & DevOps - Launch an EC2 Instance and connect an EC2 Instance using Putty & WinSCP.
I would like to share this document for those who are all interested to learn about how to launch an instance and connect the instance using Putty and WinSCP in a secured manner.
I hope this document will help further to perform any operation or to do the Linux practice and also user can write shell / bash script in that EC2 machine for their use case.
Happy Learning :)
